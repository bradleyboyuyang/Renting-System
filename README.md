# A Simple Car Renting System Database Design

This is the codebase for the final project of CSCI3170 (Database Systems) at CUHK. The goal is to realize a simple car renting system using Java JDBC API. Our project finally got the highest score in the class (98/100), with the only 2 points deducted because the popped-up messages for error handling is too simple. 

## **Executing Instructions**

### Information ###
**Group Number:   15**

Group Members:  
- Ji Yi,      1155141508
- Li Hangji,  1155141449
- Yang Boyu,  1155178392

List of files:  
- `CSCI3170proj.java`: The main program to communicate with MySQL server
- `jdbc.jar`: MySQL connector

              
### Compilation and Deployment ###
Methods of compilation and execution:

Before compilation:

- Modify `CSCI3170proj.java` to work on other MySQL server environment
- In Line 17-19:
```
String dbAddress = "jdbc:mysql://projgw.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:2633/db15";
String dbUsername = "Group15";
String dbPassword = "CSCI3170";
```
- Change the above parameters to other environment

For compilation:
- The `jdbc.jar` file should be placed in the same directory

For execution:
- `java -cp .:jdbc.jar CSCI3170proj`
