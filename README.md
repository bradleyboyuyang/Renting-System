## A Simple Car Renting System Database Design

### **Introduction**
This is the codebase for the final project of CSCI3170 (Database Systems) at CUHK. The goal is to realize a simple car renting system using Java JDBC API. Our project finally got the highest score in the class (98/100), with the only 2 points deducted because the popped-up messages for error handling is too simple.
